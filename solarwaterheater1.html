A sun-facing collector heats a working fluid that passes into a storage system for later use. SWH are active (pumped) and passive (convection-driven). They use water only, or both water and a working fluid. They are heated directly or via light-concentrating mirrors. They operate independently or as hybrids with electric or gas heaters.[2] In large-scale installations, mirrors may concentrate sunlight into a smaller collector.

The type, complexity and size of a solar water heating system is mostly determined by:

Changes in ambient temperature and solar radiation between summer and winter
Changes in ambient temperature during the day-night cycle
Possibility of the potable water or collector fluid overheating or freezing
The minimum requirements of the system are typically determined by the amount or temperature of hot water required during winter, when a system's output and incoming water temperature are typically at their lowest. The maximum output of the system is determined by the need to prevent the water in the system from becoming too hot.
