Solar Power for Your Home: Basic Concepts
Solar power can help you achieve considerable savings if you implement it at your home, and it is the easiest renewable energy source to scale down for residential applications. There are two main types of solar power systems that are commonly used in residential buildings:

Photovoltaic systems
Solar water heaters

This article will give you general information about the price and performance of photovoltaic systems.
