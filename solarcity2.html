SolarCity markets, manufactures, and installs residential and commercial solar panels in the US. It has also provided other energy services. In 2016, the company merged with Tesla, Inc. and now offers energy storage services through Tesla, including a turnkey residential battery backup service that incorporates Tesla's Powerwall. The company, in partnership with Panasonic, operates the Tesla Gigafactory 2 in Buffalo, New York, where it manufactures solar module components.

Tesla and Panasonic opened the Gigafactory, a battery factory in Nevada, in 2016, where they make a battery storage device called Powerwall that stores solar power for use as a battery backup. The device is sold to companies including SolarCity.[59][60] SolarCity ran a 2015 pilot project in 500 California houses, using 10-kilowatt-hour battery packs,[61][62] using the GridLogic software for PowerWalls as a grid backup resource.[63] This concept is also being tested in Vermont.[64]
