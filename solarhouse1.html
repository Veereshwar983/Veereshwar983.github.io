The house is set to exceed the government requirements for the 2016 zero-carbon target. The house is able to collect enough solar power to provide heating, hot water and electricity throughout the whole year. The Solar House utilizes an innovative combination of different sustainable technologies in order to collect and store solar energy ready for use at any time during the whole year.

<p>
The Solar House project has the purpose of demonstrating to members of the trade that  zero-carbon house building is possible, affordable and economically feasible. The house is a 5-bedroom estate and has already been finished and actually sold. The builders -from Caplin Homes- are ready to offer scalable solutions for house builders as the current property is quite large.
