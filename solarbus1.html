A solar bus or solar-charged bus is a bus which is powered exclusively or mainly by solar energy. A solar-powered bus service is referred to as a solar bus service. The use of the term "solar bus" normally implies that solar energy is used not only for powering electric equipment on the bus, but also for the propulsion of the vehicle.

<p>
Existing solar buses are battery electric buses or (in the case of hybrid solar buses) hybrid buses equipped with batteries which are recharged from solar (or other) power sources; a launch of a solar bus service often goes hand in hand with investments for large-scale installations of stationary solar panels with photovoltaic cells. Similarly as other solar vehicles, many solar buses have photovoltaic cells contained in solar panels on the vehicle's roof which convert the sun's energy directly into electric energy to be used by the engine.
