JR-Maglev

Maglev train in Shanghai

A maglev train in China
Maglev trains (short form of magnetic levetation) are a very fast type of High-speed rail. Magnetic levitation is a technology that uses magnetic fields to make the train move. These fields lift the train a small distance above the tracks and move the train. They are much faster than regular trains. A maglev trip from Toronto to Vancouver might take 3 hours. This trip takes three days on a regular train. Some day, people may be able to travel faster across land on a maglev train than they would in an airliner. The highest known speed of a maglev train is 603 km/h (375 mph)[1].[2] This was done in Japan in 2015. As of 2019, a few lines, only a few km long, are carrying passengers in China, South Korea, and Japan.

The magnetized coil running along the track, called a guideway, repels the large magnets on the train's undercarriage. This allows the train to lift between 0.39 and 3.93 inches (1 to 10 centimeters) above the guideway. Once the train is lifted, power is supplied to the coils within the guideway walls. This creates a unique system of magnetic fields that pull and push the train along the guideway. The electric current supplied to the coils in the guideway walls is constantly alternating to change the polarity of the magnetized coils. This change in polarity causes the magnetic field in front of the train to pull the vehicle forward, while the magnetic field behind the train adds more forward thrust.
